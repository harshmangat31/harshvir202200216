\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

In this project, we will build a software router on a Linux image using Python components. The software router will be a virtual appliance that can be deployed on various hypervisors, such as VMware, KVM, or Hyper-V. The Linux image will provide the operating system and network stack, while the Python components will implement the router's logic and functionality.

The objectives of this project are: \begin{itemize} \item To learn the fundamentals of networking, routing, and Python programming. \item To design and implement a software router that can forward packets between different networks. \item To test and evaluate the performance and scalability of the software router. \item To create a product delivery plan that includes the documentation, video presentation, and marketing website. \end{itemize}

The significance of this project is that it provides a hands-on experience in building and deploying a network appliance using open-source software and tools. It also showcases the power and flexibility of Python as a programming language for networking and automation.

\section{Theory and Background} \label{sec:theory}

\subsection{TCP Frames} \label{subsec:tcp}

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a transport-layer protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on different devices. TCP frames consist of a header and a payload, where the header contains metadata, such as source and destination ports, sequence and acknowledgment numbers, and flags.

TCP frames play a crucial role in networking, as they enable applications to communicate over the internet using a standardized and interoperable protocol. TCP frames also provide various features, such as flow control, congestion control, and retransmission, that ensure the quality and reliability of the data transmission.

\subsection{TCP/IP Stack} \label{subsec:tcpip}

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a suite of communication protocols that define the architecture and behavior of the internet. The TCP/IP stack consists of four layers: the application layer, the transport layer, the internet layer, and the link layer.

The application layer provides interfaces and services for applications to access the network, such as DNS, HTTP, and FTP. The transport layer provides reliable and efficient delivery of data between applications, using protocols such as TCP and UDP. The internet layer provides logical addressing and routing of packets across different networks, using protocols such as IP and ICMP. The link layer provides physical addressing and transmission of packets over a link, using protocols such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi.

\subsection{Theory of Routing} \label{subsec:routing}

Routing is the process of forwarding packets between different networks based on their destination addresses. Routing algorithms use various metrics, such as hop count, bandwidth, and delay, to determine the best path for a packet.

Routing can be classified into two categories: interior routing and exterior routing. Interior routing refers to the routing within a single autonomous system (AS), while exterior routing refers to the routing between different ASes. Interior routing uses protocols such as OSPF and RIP, while exterior routing uses protocols such as BGP.

\subsection{Unique Qualities of Cisco Routers} \label{subsec:cisco}

Cisco routers are high-performance and scalable networking devices that provide various features and services, such as Quality of Service (QoS), Virtual Private Network (VPN), and firewall. Cisco routers use a proprietary operating system called IOS (Internetwork Operating System), which provides a command-line interface (CLI) for configuration and management.

Cisco routers also support various interfaces, such as Ethernet, serial, and wireless, that enable them to connect to different types of networks and devices. Cisco routers also support various routing protocols, such as OSPF, BGP, and EIGRP, that enable them to exchange routing information and optimize the traffic flow.
